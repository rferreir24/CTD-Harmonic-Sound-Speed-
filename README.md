# CTD-Harmonic-Sound-Speed

 CTD data are important in acquiring sound velocity profiles of the water column to apply to multibeam sonar or other sonar data for accuracy of bathymetry measurements.

**Why is this required?** 
 The Speed of Sound in water is required to derive the range (depth) the sound travels. 

 The calculations performed assumes the sound propagates straight down to the water (Normal vertical incidence). i.e. The effects of refraction are neglected.

 Due to variability in sounds speeds at different depths, the harmonic mean sound speed is considered. However, we cannot possibly calculate every millimetre of water, instead we approximate the profile by dividing the layers of water with a constant velocity. 
 the range (depth) is calculated as 

Depth = (Two way Travel Time * Sound speed)/2
